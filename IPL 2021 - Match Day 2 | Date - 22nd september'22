Problem : Due to the rise of covid-19 cases in India, this year BCCI decided to organize knock-out matches in IPL rather than a league.
         Today is matchday 2 and it is between the most loved team Chennai Super Kings and the most underrated team - Punjab Kings. 
         Stephen Fleming, the head coach of CSK, analyzing the batting stats of Punjab. 
         He has stats of runs scored by all N players in the previous season and he wants to 
         find the maximum score for each and every contiguous sub-list of size K to strategize for the game.
Solution :
#User function Template for python3
from queue import deque
class Solution:
    def max_of_subarrays(self,arr,n,k):
        
        deq = deque() #defining double ended queue
                      #we will be storing indeces in this deq
        result = []   #to store the maximum of every contiguous sub-list of size K
        
        for i in range(k):
            
            while deq and arr[i] >= arr[deq[-1]]:         #If a new element which is greater than the preoccupied element in the queue, pop that element
                deq.pop()                                 #by doing this the maximum element will get the 1st position in the deque
                
            deq.append(i)
            
        #here we concluded the maximum element of first group of size k 
        #Now we will traverse the rest of array
        
        for j in range(k, n):
            
            result.append(arr[deq[0]])#This will be the maximum
            
            #We will check if the element in the deque goes out of curr window size or not
            #   j = 5
            #   k = 3
            #   3, 4, 5
            #   0th element <= 2           
            while deq and deq[0] <= j-k :
                deq.popleft()
                
            while deq and arr[j] >= arr[deq[-1]]: #by doing this the maximum element will get the 1st position in the deque
                deq.pop()
                
            deq.append(j)
            
        result.append(arr[deq[0]])
        return result
