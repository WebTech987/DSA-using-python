Problem :You are given a matrix of dimension n*n. All the cells are initially, zero. 
You are given Q queries, which contains 4 integers a b c d where (a,b) is the TOP LEFT cell and (c,d) is the Bottom Right cell of a submatrix.
Now, all the cells of this submatrix have to be incremented by one. After all the Q queries have been performed. 
Your task is to find the final resulting Matrix.
Note : Zero-Based Indexing is used for cells of the matrix. 


Solution :
class Solution:
    # Code here
    def solveQueries(self, n, Queries):
        #define a temporary matrix
        tem_res = [[0 for i in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
        
        #put the variable limits from column b to column d+1
        for a, b, c, d in Queries :
            for i in range(a, c+1):
                tem_res[i][b] += 1
                
            if d < n-1 :
                for i in range(a, c+1):
                    tem_res[i][d+1] -= 1
        #define final result matrix
        result = [[0 for i in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
        
        for i in range(n):
            counti = 0
            #here count is going to get updated in the next row elements from temporary result
            for j in range(n):
                counti += tem_res[i][j]
                result[i][j] = counti
                
        return result
