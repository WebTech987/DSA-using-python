#Given the base (in units) of a right-angled isoceles traingle, find the maximum number of 2X2 squares that can fit in the triangle with given base.

class Solution:
    def numberOfSquares(self, base):
        
        no_segments_unit_2 = base//2
        
        n = no_segments_unit_2 - 1
        
        no_of_squares = n*(n+1)//2
        
        return no_of_squares
